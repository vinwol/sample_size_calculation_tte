# Calculation of Sample Sizes

Shiny application for calculating the required sample size and event counts for 
clinical trials with a time-to-event endpoint (e.g., overall survival or progression-free survival), 
based on user-defined design parameters. The app leverages the [`rpact`](https://www.rpact.org/) package to 
support group sequential designs, dropout rates, and hazard ratio assumptions.
